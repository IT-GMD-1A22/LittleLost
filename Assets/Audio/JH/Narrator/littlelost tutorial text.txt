Welcome to Little Lost.

<Audio3>
You are lost and the objective is to find a way to get un-lost.

<Audio2>
I have made a little obstacle course that you have to try and pass.- But before we do that, we will have to look at the basics.


<Audio4.0>
This is you. A poor little fragile thing.

<Audio4>
To move left, press the left movement key. -
To move right, press the right movement key. -
You get the idea.

<Audio5.1>
Do that now!
<Audio5.2>
Do it already!
<Audio5.3>
We cant wait forever!
<Audio5.4>
You are so boring - Get going.

<Audio6.1 - good>
Amazing and totally unexpected. Whatever.
<Audio6.2 - good>
So you managed to follow directions? i am amazed - not really.
<Audio6.3 - good>
That went better than expected.
<Audio6.4 - good>
Very good

<Audio7>
It is also possible to Jump over obstacles and move faster by sprinting.

<Audio8>
Press the Jump button to jump. - You can also press the sprint button to sprint. Isnt that wild and unexpected?

<Audio6>

<Audio9>
Now that you have the basics of movement settled. Lets look at some map specifics. That is. If you are able to learn it.

<Audio10>
Sometimes you will be able to switch lanes.- Whenever you can do that, it will be indicated somewhere on the map.

<Audio11>
See the indicator on the floor?- It indicates that you are able to walk a new path. Move to a indicator and press either up key or down key.

<Audio6>

<Audio12.1>
If you at one point manage to get yourself into trouble. You will be able to respawn at the latest activated respawn beacon. Try moving into the indicated area now.


<Audio13.0>
Beacon is now activated. Try follow the arrows and see what happens!
<Audio12.2>
It is going to be funny, I cannot wait to see this.

<Audio13>
Wow- what a sight for sore eyes. Well, atleast you now know what not to do.- I guess you will see a lot of that.

<Audio14>
That is it. I will keep an eye on you while you make a fool of yourself. Now get unlost!


<dying1>
oh my god. Did you really just do that?
<dying2>
That was really funny. Try that again!
<dying3>
What if you do that again, but backwards?
<dying4>
How complicated can this even be?


<winner1>
Okay. Okay. So you managed to finish this level. Good for you. I guess i will have to make it harder for you.
